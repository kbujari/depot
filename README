The depot is a monorepo for my tools, infrastructure, and any other
personal projects. I treat it as a small research lab, working on
bleeding edge networking and computing projects.

A lot of the software here is used only to sustain other parts of the
repo, serving as a composable in-tree base for other functionality I can
experiment with. This repo aims to unify many related subprojects under
one roof.
