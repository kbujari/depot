xnet
====

Base configuration for any machines running a standard xnet
configuration.

Notable features:

  - Root filesystem running in RAM
  - Automated ZFS partitioning of disk
  - Hardened SSH and web services

Usage
=====

The entire module is exposed from the top-level flake as a nixosModule,
but it changes too often to be considered stable. Options are made
available when imported under the 'xnet' attribute set.
